in tissue homeostasis lab</a> 

<p> Life-long tissue homeostasis requires maintained function of differentiated cell types as well as progenitor cells, which ensure tissue self-renewal. Decades of work, have focused on how changes in gene expression, due to genetic mutation or epigenetic regulation, can result in loss of tissue homeostasis and contribute to pathologies. However, protein coding genes constitute only a small percentage of the genetic material of most eukaryotic genomes. In contrast, non-genic, repetitive DNA sequences are ubiquitous.

<p> What are the dynamics and functions of repetitive DNA sequences in diverse somatic cell-types and tissues?
