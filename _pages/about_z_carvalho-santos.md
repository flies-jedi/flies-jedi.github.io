Zita Carvalho-Santos

<p>I am a cell biologist with a deep-rooted passion for multidisciplinary approaches to science. My journey began at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) in Portugal, where I earned my PhD in Dr. Bettencourt-Dias' lab, investigating the evolution and function of molecular modules that assemble microtubule-based structures such as centrosomes and cilia. This experience sparked my fascination with the interplay between cellular architecture and physiology. I the joined Dr. Ribeiro’s lab at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, where I applied my cell biology expertise to explore how metabolism shapes biological systems where I helped developing novel frameworks for studying how cellular metabolism influences animal physiology, contributing to studying gut microbiome, feeding behavior, and reproductive biology.</p>

<p>In 2023, I established my research group, and I am currently a tenure-track group leader at GIMM – Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine, in Lisbon. Our lab is dedicated to uncovering how metabolic processes at the cellular level govern organ function and impact whole-animal traits, especially reproduction. We use a systems biology approach and the fruit fly as a model to dissect how dietary nutrients and metabolic programs interact to shape fertility, feeding behavior, and physiological homeostasis.</p>
