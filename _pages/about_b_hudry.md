<p>My group seeks to understand how sex chromosome constitution (XX versus XY) shapes physiology across the body. In particular, we aim to identify which organs actively use their sex chromosome complement to regulate physiological function, and to uncover the mechanisms by which sex chromosome effects are mediated. Despite their fundamental importance, these questions remain poorly explored, largely due to the difficulty of disentangling sex chromosome effects in complex vertebrate systems. We address these challenges using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, whose simpler yet functionally analogous sex chromosomes, combined with powerful genetic tools, allow the generation of mosaic animals in which sex chromosome composition can be manipulated in defined tissues. Using this approach, our work aims to uncover new genes, pathways, and conceptual frameworks that drive sex chromosome–dependent regulation of physiology, through multi-scale strategies integrating genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology.</p>
