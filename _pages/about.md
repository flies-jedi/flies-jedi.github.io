<h3>Who are the JEDIs</h3>
The JEDIs are early career scientists working on <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> in Europe who have recently established their independent research groups.  
The JEDI Club was founded to allow Junior European Drosophila Investigators to share ideas, expertise, and resources. This portal serves as a hub for JEDIs to get to know each other and interact, both through these pages and via our mailing list.

<h3>Can I become a JEDI?</h3>
If you lead your own Drosophila research lab for up to seven years, whether on a tenure-track or temporary position, we warmly invite you to join us.  
Please take a few minutes to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IdONgMWDSbpGU0yVqae886-zCuqj2-14dmhcGl-F8tU/viewform?edit_requested=true#responses">fill out this form</a>.

<h3>Who is behind this?</h3>
The JEDI club originated from a brainstorming session between <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/deplanckelab/" target="_blank">Bart Deplancke</a> and <a href="https://starklab.org/" target="_blank">Alex Stark</a>. Within a few months, the group grew to more than 60 members across Europe, working in universities and research institutes.  
Bart and Alex were later joined in the organization by <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.gilestro" target="_blank">Giorgio Gilestro</a>, <a href="https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/pavel-tomancak/group-leader" target="_blank">Pavel Tomancak</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogi-jaeger/" target="_blank">Yogi Yaeger</a>.
