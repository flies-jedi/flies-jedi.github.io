<p>Trying to understand what ageing is, where it comes from and where it gets us, since 2005. Building the two-phase ageing framework since I first described the Smurf phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster . I started my research group "Understanding The End-of-Life" (UTELife) in 2018.

<p>The core of the research project I am carrying is strongly transdisciplinary, from basic biology, genetics and physiology to bioinformatics and mathematical modeling.
