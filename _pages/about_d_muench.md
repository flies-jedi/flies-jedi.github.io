<p>I’m curious about how a tiny fly brain figures out what’s worth eating. In my lab, we ask how taste and smell shape feeding decisions, from how flies sense and evaluate nutrients to how hunger or internal state tips the scales. We love combining brain-wide imaging, circuit tinkering, and creative behavioral assays to follow the path from sensory input to feeding action. Along the way, we also enjoy open data, collaborations, and occasionally experimenting with our own feeding decisions.</p>
