You will be able to register here starting mid-december <a href="https://flyjedi.sciencesconf.org/" target="_blank">here</a> until February 28<sup>th</sup>.

We decided to organize that first post COVID IRL JEDI meeting at the <a href = "https://chateaudufey.com/">Château du Feÿ</a> from June 3 to 5, 2025. 
<p>For a moderate fee of 350€ including all amenities besides transportation, you'll have 3 days to present and discuss your work with a small group of junior PIs. 
<p> The goal is simple.
Each of the participant quickly presents their research work and projects, we all try to better know each other, share experiences, tips and build up our fly people network!

<p>We will have the pleasure to discuss fundamental research funding and publication process with <a href = "https://erc.europa.eu/erc_member/maria-leptin">Prof. Maria LEPTIN, <a href = "https://www.hfsp.org/almut-kelber">Prof. Almut Kelber</a>, a Company of Biologists representative and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardsever/">Dr. Richard Sever</a>.
